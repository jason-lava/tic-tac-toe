Tic-Tac-Toe -- what a classic game, now on your computer to play against your friends.

# How It's Made:
Tech used:

* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

Here I implemented 0 global code and tucked 99% of code into 1 of 2 controllers - the displayController for UI and the gameController for logic.
This was a fun project to pick apart on what controls which part, how they communicate, and general building of factory functions.


# Lessons Learned:

* factory functions
* controllers
* parsing code to eliminate global code
* securing code behind functions
* a bit of fun with CSS transforming to rotate objects
